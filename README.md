# pigJava
Simple "Pig Latin" program written in Java.

The program requests a word as input. If the user fails to provide an input, or the input is invalid (multiple words, punctuation marks, etc), the program will display an error message and prompt for input again. The input is then converted and outputted as "pig latin".
